The dimensions of a physical quantity are the powers to which the base quantities (fundamental quantities) are raised to represent that quantity. Here are some examples:
Area: The area is the product of two lengths. Therefore, the dimension of area is 2 dimensions in length and zero dimensions in mass and time. Or [A] = [M0L2T^0].
Volume: The volume is the product of three lengths. Therefore, the dimension of volume is 3 dimensions in length and zero dimensions in mass and time. Or [V] = [M0L3T^0].
Acceleration: Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity per unit of time. Therefore, the dimension of acceleration is 1 dimension in length, -2 dimensions in time and zero dimensions in mass. Or [a] = [M0L1T^-2].
The seven fundamental quantities and their symbols are as follows:
Mass: [M]
Length: [L]
Time: [T]
Temperature: [K]
Electric Current: [I]
Luminous Intensity: [cd]
Amount of Substance: [mol]
The dimensions of a physical quantity and the dimensions of its unit are the same. The letters [M], [L], [T] etc. specify only the nature of the unit and not its magnitude.
Here are the dimensions of some fundamental and derived physical quantities:
Fundamental Quantities:
Amount of substance (n): [Mol] – extensive, scalar
Length (l): [L] – extensive
Time (t): [T] – scalar, intensive, extensive
Mass (m): [M] – extensive, scalar
Temperature (T): [K] – intensive, scalar
Electric Current (I): [I] – extensive, scalar
Angle (∠): [∠ BAC] – extensive, scalar
Solid angle (Ω): [Ω] – extensive, scalar
Luminous intensity (Iv): [J] – scalar
Derived Quantities:
Area (A): [M⁰L²T⁰]
Volume (V): [M⁰L³T⁰]
Density (ρ): [ML⁻³T⁰]
Acceleration (a): [M⁰LT⁻²]
Momentum (p): [MLT⁻¹]
Energy (E): [ML²T⁻²]
Work (W): [ML²T⁻²]
Please note that the dimensions of a physical quantity are the powers to which the base quantities (fundamental quantities) are raised to represent that quantity1. For example, the area is the product of two lengths, so its dimension is [L²] or [M⁰L²T⁰], meaning it has 2 dimensions in length and zero dimensions in mass and time.
